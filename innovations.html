    <!-- ================= DIFFERENTIATION ================= -->
    <section class="about" id="about">
        <h2>What Makes TorqueSim Different?</h2>
        <p>
            TorqueSim was built to solve a real problem in the sim racing industry:
            high‑performance hardware is either extremely expensive or cheaply made.
            Our innovation focuses on delivering professional‑grade engineering at a price
            real racers can afford — without sacrificing durability, realism, or customization.

    <!-- ================= INNOVATION 1 ================= -->
    <section class="featured" id="innovation1">
        <div class="featured-content">
            <h2>Innovation #1 — TorqueSim DD18 Direct‑Drive Motor System</h2>
            <p>
                The DD18 is powered by a custom‑engineered direct‑drive motor designed to deliver
                smooth, consistent, and realistic force feedback. Unlike many competitors that rely
                on off‑the‑shelf motors, TorqueSim’s DD18 uses a reinforced rotor, precision‑machined
                shaft, and high‑efficiency windings to maximize torque output while keeping noise and
                heat extremely low.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Innovations:</h3>
            <ul class="spec-list">
                <li><strong>18 Nm peak torque</strong> for realistic race‑car steering feel</li>
                <li><strong>High‑resolution encoder</strong> for ultra‑precise steering input</li>
                <li><strong>Active cooling system</strong> to maintain performance during long sessions</li>
                <li><strong>Modular expansion panel</strong> for future add‑ons and customization</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This system gives racers the same level of immersion found in professional simulators,
                but at a fraction of the cost — making high‑end performance accessible to everyone.

        <div class="featured-content">
            <h2>Innovation #2 — Electromagnetic Adaptive Pedal System</h2>
            <p>
                Traditional sim pedals rely on springs or rubber blocks, which wear out and feel inconsistent.
                TorqueSim’s pedal set uses a fully electronic, electromagnet‑based resistance system that
                adapts to the driver in real time. This creates a braking feel that is smoother, more realistic,
                and far more durable than mechanical systems.
            </p>

            <h3>Key Innovations:</h3>
            <ul class="spec-list">
                <li><strong>6 Nm peak resistance</strong> for realistic brake pressure</li>
                <li><strong>20 individually controlled electromagnets</strong> for customizable pedal feel</li>
                <li><strong>High‑resolution position encoder</strong> for precise input detection</li>
                <li><strong>Hot‑swappable pedal modules</strong> for quick setup changes</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This technology allows drivers to fine‑tune their braking force, pedal travel, and resistance
                curve — giving them a competitive edge and a more immersive driving experience.

    <!-- ================= WHY IT MATTERS ================= -->
    <section class="about">
        <h2>Why Our Innovation Matters</h2>
        <p>
            TorqueSim’s innovations are designed around three core principles:
        </p>
        <ul class="spec-list">
            <li><strong>Realism:</strong> Hardware that feels like real motorsport equipment.</li>
            <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Components built to last, not wear out.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> High‑end performance at a fair price.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By combining engineering precision with modular design, TorqueSim gives racers the freedom
            to customize their setup, upgrade over time, and experience professional‑level immersion
            without breaking their budget.
