    <p>The story behind TorqueSim — and the person building it.</p>

        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>
            I’m Dev, the creator of TorqueSim. I’ve always been obsessed with the feeling of freedom behind the wheel —
            not just driving, but really feeling every pothole, tire screech, engine roar, and suspension flex.
            That hobby eventually grew into an idea to build hardware that makes home simulators feel like real cars.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m not a giant corporation. I’m a builder, an engineer, and most importantly, a human being who cares a lot
            about how things feel in your hands when you’re in control.

        <h2>Why I Started TorqueSim</h2>
        <p>
            All of these "premium" items I used fell apart too quickly, locked me into one system or another,
            or cost so much that only one kidney was not sufficient.
            I wanted something that was real, that lasted, something that did not punish you or your wallet.
        </p>
        <p>
            TorqueSim was founded from this need – hardware designed by folks who appreciate the details
            just as much as being able to afford them.

        <h2>My Skills & Vision</h2>
        <p>
            I love all things car-related — engines, suspension, infotainment — to the point that even my first word was “car.”
        </p>
        <p>
            The long-term goal is simple: build hardware that earns a permanent place on someone’s rig,
            without permanently denting their wallet.
